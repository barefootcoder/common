# changing it to use `--reverse -n1` to save the tail makes this much faster but wrong :-(
# apparently, the `-n1` is applied *before* the `--reverse` :-/
# using `--reverse` only and using `head` instead of `tail` is no faster
# and `--reverse` has issues (obviously), so leaving it this way for now
