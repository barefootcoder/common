Consider backing up the following:
==================================
Vagrant sandbox repos
	(for CE machines)
/var/install
/var/log
	(in case you need to see what went on before reformatting)
	you must tar this one, due to restrictive permissions
~/SpiderOak Hive/
~/Downloads/ ~/Music/ ~/Pictures/ ~/Videos/
	(if not empty)
~/hold
	(if exists)
	(may have to tar to preserve symlinks)
~/local
	(tar to preserve symlinks)
/etc
	(tar to preserve symlinks)
/etc/apt
	(untarred, for easy repo restoration)
~/.ssh
~/.ce-vagrant-prep
~/.kde

lll -R ~ >/tmp/home.listing
sudo apt list --installed >/tmp/installed.packages

Save a FF session
after final shutdown, rename machine backup on Dropbox side (via web browser)
