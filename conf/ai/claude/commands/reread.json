  "prompt": "CRITICAL: The user has made external changes and I must completely refresh my understanding of the file.\n\n**MANDATORY STEPS:**\n1. **INVALIDATE** all previous assumptions about file contents - treat as if I've never seen this file before\n2. **IDENTIFY** the file from conversation history (most recently edited/discussed file)\n3. **READ** the file using the Read tool - this is REQUIRED, not optional\n4. **COMPARE** current state against my last known state and report specific changes\n5. **VERIFY** my new understanding is correct before proceeding with any further edits\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n- I must NOT rely on any cached/remembered file state\n- I must NOT make assumptions about unchanged portions\n- I must NOT proceed with edits until I've confirmed current state\n- If unsure about any changes, I must ask for clarification\n\n**FAILURE MODE TO AVOID:** Making edits based on outdated file state, especially adding duplicate code that was already removed.\n\nAfter completing the re-read, acknowledge: \"File state refreshed - ready to proceed with current version.\"\n\nIf additional instructions follow '/reread', execute them only after completing this refresh process."
