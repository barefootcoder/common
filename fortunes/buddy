It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch.  You looked up at your sky.
That made blue be your color.  You had your knife there with you too.  When
you stood up, there was blue all over your clothes.  Your hands were sticky.
You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green.  Oh, Lord, why did
everything always have to keep changing like this?  You were already getting
nervous again.  Your head hurt, and it rang when you stood up.  Your head was
almost empty.  It always hurt you when you woke up like this.  You crawled up
out of your ditch, onto your gravel road, and began to walk, waiting for the
rest of your mind to come back to you.  You could see the car parked far down
the road, and you walked toward it.  If God is our father, you thought, then
Satan must be our cousin.  Why didn't anyone else understand these important
things?  When you got to your car, you tried all the doors; they were locked.
It was a red car, and it was new.  There was an expensive leather camera case
laying on the seat.  Out across your field, you could see two tiny people
walking by your woods.  You began to walk towards them.  Now red was your
color, and, of course, those little people out there, were yours too.

I remember I'd been in California some number of months, and
I returned to the East Coast and saw some of my old friends,
and they said, "Well, how is it out there?"  And I said, "It's
great. They've got this idea that work ought to be fun."  And
they all looked at me like I'd lost my mind.  And they said,
"How can it be fun?  Work's supposed to be productive, not
fun.  You must have been in the California hot tub too long."

What I learned is that when the world takes a tilt from
being left brain to right brain, which is what's happening
in business today--where you have to really focus on the
creative side of the job if you want to gain productivity--
people are going to be most creative and most productive when
they're doing something that they're really interested in.  I
mean really interested in.  So having fun is not an outrageous
idea at all.  It's a very sensible one.

human skills--has never grown successful firms.  A classic
example harks back to the early years of the second industrial

firms failed to reinvest dividends in the business.  Meanwhile,
the Germans and the Americans reinvested, and the British
got wiped out.  Today the Germans and the Japanese are
reinvesting.  If we keep on doing what the British did, how

Footnote to the description of the demon Crowley's computer:

Along with the standard computer warranty agreement which said that if the
machine 1) didn't work, 2) didn't do what the expensive advertisements said,
3) electrocuted the immediate neighborhood, 4) and in fact failed entirely to
be inside the expensive box when you opened it, this was expressly,
absolutely, implicitly and in no event the fault or responsibility of the
manufacturer, that the purchaser should be considered lucky to be allowed to
give his money to the manufacturer, and that any attempt to treat what had
just been paid for as the purchaser's own property would result in the
attentions of serious men with menacing briefcases and very thin watches.
Crowley had been extremely impressed with the warranties offered by the
computer industry, and had in fact sent a bundle Below to the department
that drew up the Immortal Soul agreements, with a yellow memo form attached
just saying: "Learn, guys."

"I think of time as a spherical constant," said Frank, "which means that
everything is happening all the time.  It provides an easy explanation for
premonitions, ghosts, flashbacks, because the whole concept of time that
human beings have had is taking something they can't really comprehend
and settling for a mediocre explanation of how it works.  They take a
linear approach to it, slice it in segments, and then hop from segment to
segment to segment until they die, and to me that is a pretty inefficient
way of preparing a mechanical ground base for physics.  That's one of the
reasons why I think physics doesn't work.  When you have contradictory
things in physics, one of the reasons they became contradictory is because
the formulas are tied to a concept of time that isn't the proper model.
So in my model, time is a spherical constant and everything is happening all
the time.  And we just don't have access to those segments of the sphere
that we might want to access.  Except on rare occasions where something
goes wrong with the human condition, or some wiring is changed.  In some
people the wiring may be genetically altered, and you may be able to look
not into the future, but just look 'sideways,' and come up with a glimpse
of the way things 'will be' down the road in normal person time--except
that you've just seen it now, because it's happening now as well as later."

If I had my life to live over again, I would dare to make more mistakes.
I'd relax.  I would limber up.  I would be sillier than I have been on
this trip.  I would take fewer things seriously.  I would take more trips.
I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers.  I would eat more
ice cream and less beans.  I would perhaps have more actual trouble,
but I'd have fewer imaginary ones.  You see, I'm one of those people
who live sensibly and sanely hour after hour, day after day.  Oh, I've
had my moments, and if I had it to do over again, I'd have more of them.

In fact, I'd try to have nothing else.  Just moments, one after another,
instead of living so many years ahead of each day.  I've been one of
those persons who never goes anywhere without a thermometer, a hot
water bottle, a raincoat, and a parachute.  If I had to do it over

Americans used to be famously plainspoken.  But we've gotten into a bad
habit in this country of defaulting to euphemism, reflexively replacing
any word that somebody might find disagreeable with a word that is sure
to upset nobody.

Always resorting to euphemism is a bad habit, a way of infantilizing
the culture by artificially sweetening the language.  Euphemisms are
lies--maybe white lies, nice lies, polite lies ... but still, not the
plain truth.

In other words, the impulse to euphemize amounts to a kind of infectious
Orwellian new-speak--censorship lite.  And euphemism becomes so
entrenched so quickly we don't realize our language is being switched
on us in a million tiny, everyday ways.

an easy thing to do.  I try to make a connection with someone every time I

The problem is I'm older now, I'm 40 years old, and this stuff doesn't change the world.  It really
doesn't.

I'm sorry, it's true.  Having children really changes your view on these things.  We're born, we
live for a brief instant, and we die.  It's been happening for a long time.  Technology is not
changing it much--if at all.

These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise.  You may
have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups,
get medical information, the latest experimental drugs.  These things can profoundly influence life.
I'm not downplaying that.

But it's a disservice to constantly put things in this radical new light--that it's going to change
everything.  Things don't have to change the world to be important.

When I went to law school ... I was part, virtually the last generation of American law students and
business students taught that corporations had a responsibility, because they had special priveleges
under the law, like limited liability, to their stakeholders, to their shareholders, their
employees, their customers, and the communities of which they were a part.  The, starting in the
late seventies, that practice changed, and all of a sudden the stakeholders were way up, the
shareholders were way up here, and the stakeholders were down here.  It had the ironic consequence
of giving the most influence over corporate decisions to the stakeholders with the least concern
about the long-term profitability of the corporation, and the greatest concern about the short-term
profitability.  Which accelerated a lot of these trends.

and destroy newcomers who wish the destabilize the status quo (through

I’m rather of the opinion myself that widespread myths and legends are based
on some fact, though the fact may be distorted out of all recognition in the
telling.  While I don’t go so far as to believe that stories are inspired by
actually existent spirits or powers (though I am rather opposed to flatly
denying anything) I have sometimes wondered if it were possible that
unrecognized forces of the past or present or even the future work through the
thoughts and actions of living men.  This occurred to me when I was writing
the first stories of the Conan series especially.  I know that for months I
had been absolutely barren of ideas, completely unable to work up anything
sellable.  Then the man Conan seemed suddenly to grow up in my mind without
much labor on my part and immediately a stream of stories flowed off my pen or
rather, off my typewriter almost without effort on my part.  I did not seem to
be creating, but rather relating events that had occurred.  Episode crowded on
episode so fast that I could scarcely keep up with them.  For weeks I did
nothing but write of the adventures of Conan.  The character took complete
possession of my mind and crowded out everything else in the way of
storywriting.  When I deliberately tried to write something else, I couldn’t
do it.  I do not attempt to explain this by esoteric or occult means, but the
facts remain.  I still write of Conan more powerfully and with more
understanding than any of my other characters.  But the time will probably
come when I will suddenly find myself unable to write convincingly of him at
all.  That has happened in the past with nearly all my rather numerous
characters; suddenly I would find myself out of contact with the conception,
as if the man himself had been standing at my shoulder directing my efforts,
and had suddenly turned and gone away, leaving me to search for another
character.
