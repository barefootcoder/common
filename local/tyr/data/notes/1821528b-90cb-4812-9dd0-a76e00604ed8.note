Congratulations on being chosen by your peers as a C3V Public Access Member.  You should now have access to the private C3V fora.  Please let me know if you can't see the C3V Inner Sanctum subforum, which is located under the C3V and SoV Customs subforum, or the 10 subfora underneath it.

Please feel free to browse around and look at whatever you want.  You may want to start with the PAM [url=<link:url>http://www.heroscapers.com/community/showthread.php?t=36152]welcome</link:url> thread[/url].  However, please do not post anywhere except the Inner Sanctum forum itself until we determine what department you will be primarily participating in.  Thanks.

If you have any questions, or just want to let us know you're in, please create a thread in the Inner Sanctum.  Welcome to the C3V for the next three months, and we hope you have a blast! :D</note-content>
