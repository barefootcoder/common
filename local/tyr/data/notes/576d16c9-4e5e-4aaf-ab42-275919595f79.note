Congratulations on being chosen as a new C3V member.  You should now have access to the private C3V fora.  Please let me know if you can't see the C3V Inner Sanctum subforum, which is located under the C3V and SoV Customs subforum, or the 10 subfora underneath it.

Please feel free to browse around and look at whatever you want.  You may want to start with the [url=<link:url>http://www.heroscapers.com/community/showthread.php?t=36152]welcome</link:url> thread[/url], which has some stuff about the PAM program (just ignore all that) but is still very relevant for new permanent members as well.  Please pay special attention to the posting guidelines in the OP of that thread.  Thanks.

If you have any questions, or just want to let us know you're in, please create a thread in the Inner Sanctum.  Welcome to the C3V, and have a beer on us.  But drink fast, because the whip-crackin' starts forthwith. :D</note-content>
